# Encoder and Decoder

This app allows you to encode text and decode encoded text.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Sub-folders:

- `main/coders`: where the mainCoder (parent), encoder and decoder classes are.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
